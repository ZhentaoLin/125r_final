In China, we value family the most, while in the United States, we value more about individualism. Two different cultures do not bother me but inspire me to observe more and think more. At my current stage, here is something that I found: when young people get reasonable job offers, they become satisfied. And they start to think about marriage, children, children's school and their living environment for better growth. When young people don't get job offers, they start to get panic and confused about the world. After ten years, some of those who did not get job offers become CEOs of famous startups. Some of those who did get job offers still stay in the same positions worrying about growing house prices and high expenses for their children. It means that the success of a person does not directly relate to high IQ or the immediate reward after graduation. A person may be able to finish a tough task by himself. But the person may not be able to cooperate with other people or even lead others to create a much higher power of impact. Becoming a good leader requires caring about people and nourishing the relationship. Becoming a good leader requires the person to be self-disciplined, self-aware, and driven by determination.

On the first day of my internship, my mentor told me that all the interns would present their work in a project fair two weeks after my start date. The time is minimal, and my given tasks require a lot more story points than two weeks -- one story point means one-day workload. During the given time, I learned a new programming language and used that language to write almost all of the required interfaces. My manager and mentor were able to navigate around the application smoothly. On the day of the presentation, I presented a live demo of my project and articulated my work in an attracting way. At my booth, many people from the targeted user group (sales team) came over and get surprised by the new functionality. They gave me great support on the following development, and we connected for future communication. The process drives me, and the successful result proved my spirit of the fearlessness of pressure.

I was able to control my mad emotions and listened to her stories first. It ends at being we can both listen to each other and understand our situations better. The same principles helped me in the workplace. I always ask my peers to have a one-on-one with me so that I could listen to their stories and understand them better. Sometimes such conversation gave me insights into the relationship between two of my peers. I was able to help them resolve their misunderstanding with the other one.

Support vector machine tends to have a great influence in the field of machine learning because of its kernel feature. KNN is the simplest to implement but the testing error seems to be really large if the k value is small because there exists some overfitting in the training period. What about decision tree? In this paper, the author will run svm, knn and d-tree together on 3 datasets adopted from UCI Machine Learning repository. These algorithms are implemented through sklearn models. The testing accuracy across algorithms will be compared under the same setting and also testing accuracy among the same algorithm across different partition sizes of datasets will be evaluated. The overall testing process is: preprocess the dataset, train these 3 algorithms over these datasets to gain the best hyperparameters, and then test on the testing sets to get testing accuracies for the sake of comparison.

For the k-nearest neighbors, I use a total of 26 values of k ranging from 1 to the size of the training set. The algorithm is weighted by the standard Euclidean distance.

For each partition, we do 5-fold cross validation to look for the best hyperparameter to choose for the algorithm.

Since doing classification problem is a more convenient way for us to compare all of the algorithms. So all of the datasets have to be converted to classification. COVTYPE dataset original has 7 different values of y, from 1 to 7. We can choose to predict the actual type out of the 7 values by fitting the algorithms. But when I ran it, the probability of error is too high. Since when I was computing the accuracy, I used \u201c==\u201d rather than covariance. So to the problem, predicting 5 instead of 2 if the correct value is 6 has no difference. And my training set, relative to my total number of set is relatively low, even less than 1/50. So I choose to treat the largest class(the one that has the most instances) as positive, and the rest instances as negative. In this case, we can predict a binary value.

There are 3 datasets in total. I ran svm, knn and decision trees on each of them. In that way, I want to observe the benefit of each algorithm by comparing the result of different algorithms running on the same dataset. More specifically, I was comparing the average testing accuracy gained after each experiment. And for each algorithm on each dataset, I use different number of training sets and testing sets. I increase the ratio of training sets and testing sets from 20:80 to 50:50 to 80:20. So I can see the effect of increasing training set.",r.a.createElement("br",null),"The result is surprising. KNN turns out to be the best algorithm among the three. To be clear, the support vector machine I implemented is using the linear kernel. The result shows that as the dataset increases, the ACC of linear svm will become worse than usual. It decreases from 0.75 down to 0.62. Decision tree is an algorithm that performs well on every dataset, in the range of 0.75 to 0.85. While k-nearest neighbors performs really great on the testing set, unexpected as I previously thought. It even get the average testing error above 90% on the letter dataset. And the performances of knn on the other two datasets are also not bad, around 70% to 80%. Another comparison result is expected. As I increase the size of the training set and decrease the size of the testing set, the testing accuracy is slightly getting better over time.

Then I was looking for a way to scale the dataset so that it can be faster to implement. The solutions turns out to be the method called linearSVC. This is also a sklearn model and is equivalent to using the standard svm method with the linear kernel. By using this model, the speed increases by a large amount. My colleague suggests that the running time of linearSVC is O(n), while the running time of the standard svm is O(n^3). Another computational challenge I encountered is that sklearn model can only be run on CPU rather than GPU. So I cannot utilize more powerful processing units to compute parallely. So when the datasets get really large, running the algorithm will take a large amount of time without scaling.
